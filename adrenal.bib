               into front-line health facilities. In this paper, we examine the
               current state of the art in CV as applied to the medical domain.
               We discuss the main challenges in CV and intelligent data-driven
               medical applications and suggest future directions to accelerate
               research, development, and deployment of CV applications in
               health practices. First, we critically review existing literature

               medical image classification; shape and object recognition from
               images; and medical segmentation. Second, we present an in-depth

               (CSI) for differentiating between adrenal adenomas and
               non-adenomas. Methods: A systematic search of the MEDLINE, Web of
               Science Core Collection, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of
               Controlled Trials electronic databases was performed. The
               methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by
               using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
               Studies) tool. A bivariate random effect model was used to
               determine summary and subgroup sensitivity and specificity and
               calculate summary receiver operating characteristic curves
               (SROC). Results: Eighteen studies with 1138 patients and 1280
               lesions (859 adenomas, 421 non-adenomas) in total were included.
               In addition to summary analysis, quantitative analyses of the
               adrenal signal intensity index (SII, 978 lesions, 14 studies),
               adrenal-to-spleen ratio (ASR; 394 lesions, 7 studies) and visual
               analysis (560 lesions, 5 studies) were performed. The resultant
               data showed considerable heterogeneity (inconsistency index I2 of
               94\%, based on the diagnostic odds ratio, DOR). The pooled
               sensitivity of CSI for adenoma was 0.94 [95\% confidence interval
               (CI) 0.88–0.97] and pooled specificity was 0.95 (95\% CI
               0.89–0.97). The area (AUC) under the SROC curve was 0.98 (95\% CI
               0.96–0.99). The corresponding AUCs were 0.98, 0.99 and 0.95 for
               SII, ASR and visual evaluation, respectively. Conclusion: CSI has
               high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for adrenal adenoma.
               Diagnostic performance does not improve when quantitative indices
               are used. Key Points: • Inclusion of CSI in abdominal MRI
               protocols provides an effective solution for classifying adrenal
               masses discovered on MR exams • Visual evaluation of adrenal CSI
               is sufficient; use of quantitative indices does not improve
               diagnostic accuracy.",

              are two subtypes of benign adrenal adenoma, and their differential
              diagnosis is crucial. Current diagnostic procedures use an
              invasive method, adrenal venous sampling, for endocrinologic
              assessment. METHODS: This study proposes establishing an accurate
              differential model for subtyping adrenal adenoma using computed
              tomography (CT) radiomic features and machine learning (ML)
              methods. Dataset 1 (289 patients with adrenal adenoma) was
              collected to develop the models, and Dataset 2 (54 patients) was
              utilized for external validation. Cuboids containing the lesion
              were cropped from the non-contrast, arterial, and venous phase CT
              images, and 1,967 features were extracted from each cuboid. Ten
              discriminative features were selected from each phase or the
              combined phases. Random forest, support vector machine, logistic
              regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Machine, and eXtreme Gradient
              Boosting were used to establish prediction models. RESULTS: The
              highest accuracies were 72.7\%, 72.7\%, and 76.1\% in the
              arterial, venous, and non-contrast phases, respectively, when
              using radiomic features alone with the ML classifier of LR. When
              features from the three CT phases were combined, the accuracy of
              LR reached 83.0\%. After adding clinical information, the area
              under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased for
              all the machine learning methods except for LR. In Dataset 2, the
              accuracy of LR was the highest, reaching 77.8\%. CONCLUSION: The
              radiomic features of the lesion in three-phase CT images can
              potentially suggest the functioning or non-functioning nature of
              adrenal adenoma. The resulting radiomic models can be a
              non-invasive, low-cost, and rapid method of minimizing unnecessary

               require additional diagnostic steps after the initial CT. The
               purpose of this study was to evaluate if texture analysis of
               CT-abnormal adrenal glands on the initial CT correctly
               differentiates between malignant and benign lesions in patients
               with confirmed lung cancer. Materials and methods: In this
               retrospective study 160 patients with endoscopic
               ultrasound-guided biopsy from the left adrenal gland and a
               contrast-enhanced CT in portal venous phase were assessed with
               texture analysis. A region of interest encircling the entire
               adrenal gland was used and from this dataset the slice with the
               largest cross section of the lesion was analyzed individually.
               Results: Several texture parameters showed statistically
               significantly difference between metastatic and benign lesions

                 transform images into quantifiable feature sets producing
                 summary statistics that describe enhancement distributions of
                 solid masses. Relying on empirical distributional summaries,
                 conventional approaches to cancer radiomics analysis are
                 limited by the application of regression or machine learning
                 algorithms to correlated feature sets. Moreover, often relying
                 on summary statistics that derive from a single scan, current
                 analytical approaches ignore temporal patterns that describe
                 washout across multiple scans with contrast. Motivated by the
                 diagnosis of adrenal masses on the basis of dynamic contrast

               benign from malignant lesions. In the absence of clear signs of
               invasion or metastases, imaging techniques do not always

               aimed to determine whether radiomics may predict malignancy in
               adrenocortical tumours. METHODS: CT images in unenhanced,
               arterial, and venous phases from 19 patients who had undergone
               resection of adrenocortical tumours and a cohort who had
               undergone surveillance for at least 5 years for incidentalomas
               were reviewed. A volume of interest was drawn for each lesion
               using dedicated software, and, for each phase, first-order
               (histogram) and second-order (grey-level colour matrix and
               run-length matrix) radiological features were extracted. Data
               were revised by an unsupervised machine learning approach using
               the K-means clustering technique. RESULTS: Of operated patients,
               nine had non-functional adenoma and 10 carcinoma. There were 11
               patients in the surveillance group. Two first-order features in
               unenhanced CT and one in arterial CT, and 14 second-order
               parameters in unenhanced and venous CT and 10 second-order

               adrenocortical carcinoma from adenoma (P < 0.050). After
               excluding two malignant outliers, the unsupervised machine

               accurately impacts preoperative preparation and surgical outcome
               in PHEO patients. Highly reliable model to diagnose PHEO is
               lacking. We aimed to develop a magnetic resonance imaging
               (MRI)-based radiomic-clinical model to distinguish PHEO from
               adrenal lesions. Methods: In total, 305 patients with 309 adrenal
               lesions were included and divided into different sets. The least
               absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression
               model was used for data dimension reduction, feature selection,
               and radiomics signature building. In addition, a nomogram
               incorporating the obtained radiomics signature and selected
               clinical predictors was developed by using multivariable logistic
               regression analysis. The performance of the radiomic-clinical
               model was assessed with respect to its discrimination,
               calibration, and clinical usefulness. Results: Seven radiomics
               features were selected among the 1301 features obtained as they
               could differentiate PHEOs from other adrenal lesions in the
               training (area under the curve [AUC], 0.887), internal validation
               (AUC, 0.880), and external validation cohorts (AUC, 0.807).
               Predictors contained in the individualized prediction nomogram
               included the radiomics signature and symptom number (symptoms
               include headache, palpitation, and diaphoresis). The training set
               yielded an AUC of 0.893 for the nomogram, which was confirmed in
               the internal and external validation sets with AUCs of 0.906 and
               0.844, respectively. Decision curve analyses indicated the
               nomogram was clinically useful. In addition, 25 patients with 25
               lesions were recruited for prospective validation, which yielded
               an AUC of 0.917 for the nomogram. Conclusion: We propose a
               radiomic-based nomogram incorporating clinically useful

  abstract = "Objective: The accurate classification of mass lesions in the
              adrenal glands (‘adrenal masses’), detected with computed
              tomography (CT), is important for diagnosis and patient
              management. Adrenal masses can be benign or malignant and benign
              masses have varying prevalence. Classification methods based on
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art in
              maximizing inter-class differences in large medical imaging
              training datasets. The application of CNNs, to adrenal masses is
              challenging due to large intra-class variations, large inter-class
              similarities and imbalanced training data due to the size of the
              mass lesions. Methods: We developed a deep multi-scale resemblance
              network (DMRN) to overcome these limitations and leveraged paired
              CNNs to evaluate the intra-class similarities. We used multi-scale
              feature embedding to improve the inter-class separability by
              iteratively combining complementary information produced at
              different scales of the input to create structured feature
              descriptors. We augmented the training data with randomly sampled
              paired adrenal masses to reduce the influence of imbalanced
              training data. Results: We used 229 CT scans of patients with
              adrenal masses for evaluation. In a five-fold cross-validation,
              our method had the best results (89.52 \% in accuracy) when
              compared to the state-of-the-art methods (p < 0.05). We conducted
              a generalizability analysis of our method on the ImageCLEF 2016
              competition dataset for medical subfigure classification, which
              consists of a training set of 6776 images and a test set of 4166
              images across 30 classes. Our method achieved better
              classification performance (85.90 \% in accuracy) when compared to
              the existing methods and was competitive when compared with
              methods that require additional training data (1.47 \% lower in
              accuracy). Conclusion: Our DMRN sub-classified adrenal masses on

               their characterization and diagnosis a challenge. With the advent
               of cancer radiomics, a variety of techniques have been developed
               to transform images into quantifiable feature sets producing
               summary statistics that describe the morphology and texture of
               solid masses. Relying on empirical distribution summaries as well
               as grey-level co-occurrence statistics, several approaches have
               been devised to characterize tissue density heterogeneity. This
               article proposes a novel decision-tree based approach which
               quantifies the tissue density heterogeneity of a given lesion
               through its resultant distribution of tree-structured
               dissimilarity metrics computed with least common ancestor trees
               under repeated pixel re-sampling. The methodology, based on
               statistics derived from Galton-Watson trees, produces metrics
               that are minimally correlated with existing features, adding new
               information to the feature space and improving quantitative
               characterization of the extent to which a CT image conveys
               heterogeneous density distribution. We demonstrate its practical
               application through a diagnostic study of adrenal lesions.

              mass-containing and to assess algorithm performance. Materials and
              Methods This retrospective study included two groups of
              contrast-enhanced abdominal CT examinations (development data set
              and secondary test set). Adrenal glands in the development data
              set were manually segmented by radiologists. Images in both the
              development data set and the secondary test set were manually
              classified as normal or mass-containing. Deep learning
              segmentation and classification models were trained on the
              development data set and evaluated on both data sets. Segmentation
              performance was evaluated with use of the Dice similarity
              coefficient (DSC), and classification performance with use of
              sensitivity and specificity. Results The development data set
              contained 274 CT examinations (251 patients; median age, 61 years;
              133 women), and the secondary test set contained 991 CT
              examinations (991 patients; median age, 62 years; 578 women). The
              median model DSC on the development test set was 0.80 (IQR,
              0.78-0.89) for normal glands and 0.84 (IQR, 0.79-0.90) for adrenal
              masses. On the development reader set, the median interreader DSC
              was 0.89 (IQR, 0.78-0.93) for normal glands and 0.89 (IQR,
              0.85-0.97) for adrenal masses. Interreader DSC for radiologist
              manual segmentation did not differ from automated machine
              segmentation (P = .35). On the development test set, the model had
              a classification sensitivity of 83\% (95\% CI: 55, 95) and
              specificity of 89\% (95\% CI: 75, 96). On the secondary test set,
              the model had a classification sensitivity of 69\% (95\% CI: 58,
              79) and specificity of 91\% (95\% CI: 90, 92). Conclusion A
              two-stage machine learning pipeline was able to segment the
              adrenal glands and differentiate normal adrenal glands from those
              containing masses. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is

               lesions may be challenging to confidently identify those that
               need to be resected. Although many adrenal lesions can be readily
               diagnosed when they display typical imaging features, the
               diagnosis may be challenging for atypical lesions. Computed
               tomography (CT) remains the cornerstone of adrenal imaging, but
               other morphological or functional modalities can be used in
               combination to reach a diagnosis and avoid useless biopsy or
               surgery. Early- and delayed-phase contrast-enhanced CT images are
               essential for diagnosing lipid-poor adenoma. Ongoing studies are

              women, 76 men; mean age 56.58 ± 13.65 years) were evaluated
              between January 2015 and December 2019. The lesions consisted of
              54 lipid-rich adrenal adenomas, 37 lipid-poor adrenal adenomas
              (LPAs), 56 adrenal metastases (ADM), and 19 adrenal
              pheochromocytomas (APhs). Each adrenal lesion was segmented by
              manually contouring the borders of the lesion on unenhanced CT
              images. A texture analysis of the CT images was performed using
              Local Image Feature Extraction software. First-order and
              second-order texture parameters were assessed, and 45 features
              were extracted from each lesion. One-Way analysis of variance with

               adrenal lesions, often characterized based on intralesional fat
               content as either lipid-rich (LRA) or lipid-poor (LPA). The
               differentiation of AA, particularly LPA, from nonadenoma adrenal
               lesions (NAL) may be challenging. Texture analysis (TA) can
               extract quantitative parameters from MR images. Machine learning
               is a technique for recognizing patterns that can be applied to
               medical images by identifying the best combination of TA features
               to create a predictive model for the diagnosis of interest.
               Purpose/Hypothesis: To assess the diagnostic efficacy of
               TA-derived parameters extracted from MR images in characterizing
               LRA, LPA, and NAL using a machine-learning approach. Study Type:
               Retrospective, observational study.
               Population/Subjects/Phantom/Specimen/Animal Model: Sixty MR
               examinations, including 20 LRA, 20 LPA, and 20 NAL. Field
               Strength/Sequence: Unenhanced T 1 -weighted in-phase (IP) and
               out-of-phase (OP) as well as T 2 -weighted (T 2 -w) MR images
               acquired at 3T. Assessment: Adrenal lesions were manually
               segmented, placing a spherical volume of interest on IP, OP, and
               T 2 -w images. Different selection methods were trained and
               tested using the J48 machine-learning classifiers. Statistical
               Tests: The feature selection method that obtained the highest
               diagnostic performance using the J48 classifier was identified;
               the diagnostic performance was also compared with that of a
               senior radiologist by means of McNemar's test. Results: A total
               of 138 TA-derived features were extracted; among these, four
               features were selected, extracted from the IP
               (Short\_Run\_High\_Gray\_Level\_Emphasis), OP (Mean\_Intensity
               and Maximum\_3D\_Diameter), and T 2 -w (Standard\_Deviation)
               images; the J48 classifier obtained a diagnostic accuracy of
               80\%. The expert radiologist obtained a diagnostic accuracy of
               73\%. McNemar's test did not show significant differences in

               features can give a trace about the type of adrenal tumours;
               however, they cannot be observed all the time. Different tumour
               types can be confused in terms of having a similar shape, size

               modalities and biopsy process is wanted to be excluded. The used

              created with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics and

              were evaluated. The lesions were segmented on unenhanced
              T1-weighted in-phase (IP) and opposed-phase (OP) as well as on
              T2-weighted (T2-W) 3Tesla MRIs. The LASSO regression model was
              used to select potential predictors from 108 texture features for
              each sequence. Subsequently, a combined radiomics score and
              clinical features were created and compared. RESULTS: A
              significant difference was found between median rad-scores for
              ACSAI and NFAI in training and test sets (p < 0.05 for all
              sequences). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed
              that the length of the tumor (OR = 1.09, p = 0.007) was an
              independent risk factor related to ACSAI. Multivariate logistic
              regression analysis was used for building clinical-radiomics
              (combined) models. The Op, IP, and IP plus T2-W model had a higher

              the test dataset, respectively. CONCLUSION: ACSAI can be
              distinguished from NFAI with high accuracy on unenhanced MRI.
              Radiomics analysis and the model constructed by machine learning

              of distinguishing ad-enomas from malignant adrenal lesions using
              chemical shift fast low-angle shot MR imaging. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS. We assessed 102 adrenal tumors in 88 patients (27
              hy-perfunctioning and 44 nonhyperfunctioning adenomas, 19
              metastases, nine pheochromocyto-mas, and three other adrenal
              tumors) using chemical shift MR imaging. On the chemical shift
              imaging, signal intensity index, calculated as [(signal intensity
              on in-phase imaging-signal intensity on opposed-phase imaging) /
              (signal intensity on in-phase imaging)] × 100\%, was compared with
              the adrenal-to-spleen ratio, adrenal-to-muscle ratio, and
              adrenal-to-liver ratio for signal change on opposed-phase fast
              low-angle shot MR imaging. The tissues in the spleen, paraspinal
              muscle, and liver were reference tissues. RESULTS. The signal
              intensity index had several advantages over the other three
              parameters calculated. We found no overlap in indexes between
              adenomas and metastatic tumors. The accuracy in distinguishing
              adenomas from metastatic tumors was 100\% if the cutoff value of
              the signal intensity index selected was 11.2-16.5\%. CONCLUSION.
              The signal intensity index is the most reliable evaluation method
              for differentiating adrenal adenomas from metastatic adrenal
              tumors. ccurate characterization of adre-nal masses has been a
              focus of medical imaging for many years. Adrenal masses are
              detected with increasing frequency as an incidental finding during
              cross-sectional imaging, such as CT or abdominal sonography [1,
              2]. When adrenal masses are discovered, two critical tasks are
              distinguishing benign from malignant lesions and determining
              whether the lesion is primary or secondary. If no evidence of
              other metastatic lesions is present, the accurate staging of
              tumors in patients with known malignant disease may depend on
              correctly diagnosing an adre-nal mass. Also important is
              determining whether the adrenal lesion is a cortical ade-noma or a
              nonadenoma; some nonadenomas, such as pheochromocytomas, may be
              malignant and usually require surgical removal. In 1992, Mitchell
              et al. [3] reported that chemical shift techniques and simple
              visual analyses could be used to help identify adre-nal adenomas
              by detecting the lipid frequently present in these tumors.
              Chemical shift-induced signal intensity changes for the adrenal
              mass relative to the liver and muscle were calculated by comparing
              these ratios on conventional T1-weighted images and chemical shift
              images. Tsushima et al. [4] described the utility of chemical
              shift fast low-angle shot (FLASH) imaging for differentiating
              adrenal masses. When the signal intensity indexes of adrenal
              masses, calculated as [(signal intensity on in-phase
              imaging-signal intensity on opposed phase imaging) / (signal
              intensity on in-phase imaging)] × 100\%, were determined, all
              adenomas had signal intensity indexes that were greater than 5\%,
              whereas the signal intensity indexes of metastatic tumors and
              pheo-chromocytomas were less than 5\%. These researchers found
              that the degree of accuracy for differentiating adenomas from
              nonade-nomas was 100\%. Although the value of chemical shift
              imaging for accurately diagnosing adrenal masses has been
              established in a number of quantitative [3-11] and qualitative
              studies [5, 7, 9], considerable differences in methodology have
              made direct comparisons difficult. These differences include
              magnetic field strength, gradient strength, TE, and the formulas

               MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, 23 adrenal
               nodules (15 lipid-poor adenomas and eight adrenal malignancies)
               in 20 patients (nine female patients and 11 male patients; mean
               age, 59 years [range, 15–80 years]) were assessed. All patients
               underwent unenhanced CT, CECT, and chemical-shift MRI. Twenty-one
               second-order texture features from the gray-level cooccurrence
               matrix and gray-level run-length matrix were calculated in 3D.
               The mean values for 21 texture features and four imaging features
               (lesion size, unenhanced CT attenuation, CECT attenuation, and
               signal intensity index) were compared using a t test. The
               diagnostic performance of texture analysis versus imaging
               features was also compared using AUC values. Multivariate
               logistic regression models to predict malignancy were constructed
               for texture analysis and imaging features. RESULTS. Lesion size,
               unenhanced CT attenuation, and the signal intensity index showed
               significant differences between benign and malignant adrenal
               nodules. No significant difference was seen for CECT attenuation.
               Eighteen of 21 CECT texture features and nine of 21 unenhanced CT
               texture features revealed significant differences between benign
               and malignant adrenal nodules. CECT texture features (mean AUC
               value, 0.80) performed better than CECT attenuation (mean AUC
               value, 0.60). Multivariate logistic regression models showed that
               CECT texture features, chemical-shift MRI texture features, and
               imaging features were predictive of malignancy. CONCLUSION.
               Texture analysis has a potential role in distinguishing benign
               from malignant adrenal nodules on CECT and may decrease the need
               for additional imaging studies in the workup of incidentally
               discovered adrenal nodules.",

              lipid-poor adenoma (LPA) in adrenal incidentaloma (AI). Methods:
              Seventy-nine patients with 80 LPA and 29 patients with 30 sPHEO
              were included in the study. Texture parameters were derived using
              imaging software (MaZda). Thirty texture features were selected
              and LPA was performed for the features selected. The number of
              positive features was used to predict results. Logistic multiple
              regression analysis was performed on the 30 texture features, and
              a predictive equation was created based on the coefficients
              obtained. Results: LPA yielded a misclassification rate of 19.39\%
              in differentiating sPHEO from LPA. Our predictive model had an
              accuracy rate of 94.4\% (102/108), with a sensitivity of 86.2\%

               on abdominal area scans. Adrenal tumors, which are incidentally
               detected, release vital hormones. These types of tumors that can
               be malignant affect body metabolism. Both of benign and malign
               adrenal tumors can have a similar size, intensity, and shape,
               this situation may lead to wrong decision during diagnosis and
               characterization of tumors. Thus, biopsy is done to confirm
               diagnosis of tumor types. In this study, adrenal tumor
               characterization is handled by using magnetic resonance images.
               In this way, it is wanted that patient can be disentangled from
               one or more imaging modalities (some of them can includes X-ray)
               and biopsy. An adrenal tumor image set, which includes five types
               of adrenal tumors and has 112 benign tumors and 10 malign tumors,
               was used in this study. Two data sets were created from the
               adrenal tumor image set by manually/semiautomatically segmented
               adrenal tumors and feature sets of these data sets are
               constituted by different methods. Two-dimensional gray-level
               co-occurrence matrix (2D-GLCM), gray-level run-length matrix
               (GLRLM), and two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT)
               methods were analyzed to reveal the most effective features on
               adrenal tumor characterization. Feature sets were classified in
               two ways: benign/malign (binary classification) and type
               characterization (multiclass classification). Support vector
               machine and artificial neural network classified feature sets.
               The best performance on benign/malign classification was obtained
               by the 2D-GLCM feature set. The best results were assessed with
               sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score
               metrics and they were 99.17\%, 90\%, 98.4\%, 99.17\%, and

               January 1999 and June 2003, 40 patients (42 adrenal masses)
               underwent unenhanced CT and chemical shift MRI and were

               chemical shift ratio, and signal-intensity index were obtained
               for each adrenal mass. Qualitative analysis for loss of signal in
               each adrenal mass on the opposed-phase images was also performed
               by two reviewers and compared with the quantitative analyses. A
               lipid-rich adenoma was diagnosed if the mass measured equal to or

              accidentally discovered adrenal mass on imaging performed for the
              investigation of an unrelated complaint. Adrenal incidentalomas
              (AIs) are a cluster of different pathologies, the majority of
              which are benign and non-functioning adrenal adenomas. However,
              mild hormonal alterations as well as metabolic abnormalities may
              be present in patients with AIs. Thus, a multidisciplinary
              approach with biochemical and radiologic evaluation is needed to
              characterize these lesions and identify patients who are at high
              risk for hormonal or malignant evolution. Significant new
              information has helped resolve controversies regarding the most
              reliable approach to this clinical problem. The present review
              considers the prevalence, pathology and natural history of AIs. We
              also discuss the reliability of available screening methods and
              lo-calization techniques and consider optimal management and
              follow-up strategies.",

               T2-weighted imaging based on support vector machine (SVM) can
               distinguish pheochromocytoma from adrenal adenoma. Methods: A
               pathology database was retrospectively appraised over a period of
               7 years and we obtained 40 histopathologically proven adrenal
               adenomas and 20 pheochromocytomas with magnetic resonance images.
               The T1-weighted imaging (T1WI, including both in phase and
               opposed phase) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) images of each
               patients were analyzed using Mazda software. Nine parameters were
               selected as indicators of comparison: variance, skewness,
               kurtosis, mean, 1st percentile, 10th percentile, 50th percentile,
               90th percentile, and 99th percentile. The parameters with
               differential-diagnosis significance were used to establish the
               combined diagnostic model of SVM. Results: Among the 9 parameters
               extracted using histogram analysis, the 1st percentile, 10th
               percentile, and 50th percentile of T1WI (in phase) and the
               skewness of T2WI and almost all parameters of T1WI (opposed
               phase), except variance and 99th percentile, showed statistical
               significance between groups. Among the above parameters, the area
               under the curve (AUC) of 10th percentile of T1WI (opposed phase)

               performed, the AUC of SVM model in testing set showed the value
               of 0.917 (85.0\% accuracy). Conclusions: Whole-lesion histogram
               analysis of T1WI and T2WI may help differentiate adrenal adenomas
               from pheochromocytomas. Furthermore, the combined diagnosis of

              who underwent abdominal CT (non-contrast, early, and delayed
              phases) with 107 adrenal lesions (83 AAs and 24 non-AAs) confirmed

              metastatic carcinomas. Three patients had adrenal lesions on both
              sides. We constructed six DCNN models from six types of input
              images for comparison: non-contrast images only (Model A), delayed
              phase images only (Model B), three phasic images merged into a
              3-channel (Model C), relative washout rate (RWR) image maps only
              (Model D), non-contrast and RWR maps merged into a 2-channel
              (Model E), and delayed phase and RWR maps merged into a 2-channel
              (Model F). These input images were prepared manually with cropping
              and registration of CT images. Each DCNN model with six

              the models and the inner fivefold cross-validation was used to
              tune hyperparameters of the models. Results: The areas under the

               quantifiable summary statistics to which regression and machine
               learning algorithms may be applied for statistical interrogation.
               Recent literature has identified clinicopathological association
               based on textural features deriving from gray-level co-occurrence
               matrices (GLCM) which facilitate evaluations of gray-level
               spatial dependence within a delineated region of interest.
               GLCM-derived features, however, tend to contribute highly
               redundant information. Moreover, when reporting selected feature
               sets, investigators often fail to adjust for multiplicities and
               commonly fail to convey the predictive power of their findings.
               This article presents a Bayesian probabilistic modeling framework
               for the GLCM as a multivariate object as well as describes its
               application within a cancer detection context based on computed
               tomography. The methodology, which circumvents processing steps
               and avoids evaluations of reductive and highly correlated feature
               sets, uses latent Gaussian Markov random field structure to
               characterize spatial dependencies among GLCM cells and
               facilitates classification via predictive probability. Correctly
               predicting the underlying pathology of 81\% of the adrenal
               lesions in our case study, the proposed method outperformed
               current practices which achieved a maximum accuracy of only 59\%.
               Simulations and theory are presented to further elucidate this
               comparison as well as ascertain the utility of applying
               multivariate Gaussian spatial processes to GLCM objects.",

              value of radiomics in adrenal tumors by quantitative analysis.
              METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library
              databases were searched for eligible literature. Methodological
              quality and risk of bias in the included studies were assessed by
              the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2)
              and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). The diagnostic performance was
              evaluated by pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds
              ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC). Spearman's
              correlation coefficient and subgroup analysis were used to
              investigate the cause of heterogeneity. Publication bias was
              examined using the Deeks' funnel plot. RESULTS: Twenty-eight
              studies investigating the diagnostic performance of radiomics in
              adrenal tumors were identified, with a total of 3579 samples. The
              average RQS was 5.11 (14.2\% of total) with an acceptable
              inter-rater agreement (ICC 0.94, 95\% CI 0.93-0.95). The risk of
              bias was moderate according to the result of QUADAS-2. Nine
              studies investigating the use of CT-based radiomics in
              differentiating malignant from benign adrenal tumors were included
              in the quantitative analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity,
              DOR and AUC with 95\% confidence intervals were 0.80 (0.68-0.88),
              0.83 (0.73-0.90), 19.06 (7.87-46.19) and 0.88 (0.85-0.91),
              respectively. There was significant heterogeneity among the
              included studies but no threshold effect in the meta-analysis. The
              result of subgroup analysis demonstrated that radiomics based on
              unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT possessed higher diagnostic
              performance, and second-order or higher-order features could
              enhance the diagnostic sensitivity but also increase the false
              positive rate. No significant difference in diagnostic ability was
              observed between studies with machine learning and those without.
              CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality and risk of bias of
              studies investigating the diagnostic performance of radiomics in
              adrenal tumors should be further improved in the future. CT-based
              radiomics has the potential benefits in differentiating malignant
              from benign adrenal tumors. The heterogeneity between the included

               0.819–0.945]. Moreover, the nomogram representing the integrated
               model achieved good discrimination performances, which yielded a
               sensitivity of 0.915, a specificity of 0.928, and an accuracy of
               0.922 (AUC = 0.902, 95\% CI = 0.822–0.982), and it was better

               the subtypes of hormone-secreting functional adrenocortical

               intelligence that has seen exponential growth in recent years.
               The scientific community has focused its attention on DL due to
               its versatility, high performance, high generalization capacity,
               and multidisciplinary uses, among many other qualities. In
               addition, a large amount of medical data and the development of
               more powerful computers has also fostered an interest in this
               area. This paper presents an overview of current deep learning
               methods, starting from the most straightforward concept but
               accompanied by the mathematical models that are behind the
               functionality of this type of intelligence. In the first
               instance, the fundamental concept of artificial neural networks

               neoplasms of the adrenal gland, and are seen in up to 5\% of
               computed tomography (CT) examinations of the abdomen. Better
               identification of these lesions is important for effective
               management and patient prognosis. Detection on low-contrast CT
               images, however, even for experienced physicians can be difficult
               and error-prone, because the lesions are often problematic to be
               separated from the normal surrounding structures. Existing lesion
               detection techniques have problems in identifying and
               differentiating low-contrast tumors, which is related to their
               use of low-level features rather than high level of semantics.
               Hence we propose an automated approach using fully convolutional
               networks (FCNs) and multi-scale integration to detect adrenal
               lesion on low-contrast CT scans. The architecture of FCNs
               includes deep, coarse, semantic information and shallow, fine,
               appearance information in a hierarchical manner and it enables
               the encoding of image-wide location and semantics, which are
               desirable characteristics for adrenal lesion detection. We also
               propose a multi-scale integration with a superpixel based random
               walk (MI-SRW) approach to refine the lesion boundaries on
               different scales. The MI-SRW technique enables us to constrain
               the spatial and appearance consistency and then use complementary
               information provided on different scales to detect adrenal
               lesions of various sizes and characteristics. We used 38 adrenal
               lesions detected on low-contrast CT and compared our approach to
               existing 'state-of-the-art' methods and found that our approach
               had superior detection performance.",

               of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at
               multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment.
               These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging
               could augment patient stratification and prognostication
               buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. In recent

               Manual 3D segmentation on T2-weighted and CS images was performed
               for subsequent radiomic feature extraction. After feature
               stability testing and an 80-20\% train-test split, the train set

               preventive, and personalized medical approach to the management
               of adrenal tumors. Patients and methods: This retrospective study
               consisted of 265 consecutive patients (training cohort, 212 (LPA,
               145; sPHEO, 67); validation cohort, 53 (LPA, 36; sPHEO, 17)).
               Computed tomography (CT) imaging features were evaluated,
               including long diameter (LD), short diameter (SD), pre-enhanced
               CT value (CTpre), enhanced CT value (CTpost), shape, homogeneity,
               necrosis or cystic degeneration (N/C). Radiomic features were
               extracted and then were used to construct a radiomic signature
               (Rad-score) and radiomic nomogram. The area under the receiver
               operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate their
               performance. Results: Sixteen of three hundred forty candidate
               features were used to build a radiomic signature. The signature
               was significantly different between the sPHEO and LPA groups
               (AUC: training, 0.907; validation, 0.902). The radiomic nomogram
               based on enhanced CT features (M1) consisted of Rad-score, LD,
               SD, CTpre, shape, homogeneity and N/C (AUC: training, 0.957;
               validation, 0.967). The pre-enhanced CT features based radiomic

               homogeneity (AUC: training, 0.955; validation, 0.958).
               Conclusions: Our radiomic nomograms based on pre-enhanced and
               enhanced CT images distinguished sPHEO from LPA. In addition, the
               promising result using pre-enhanced CT images for predictive

               literature, it is important to understand the fundamental
               principles of AI. Training, validation, and test datasets must be
               defined and set apart as priorities. External validation and
               testing datasets are preferable, when feasible. The specific type
               of learning process (supervised vs. unsupervised) and the machine
               learning model also require definition. Deep learning (DL) is an
               AI-based approach that is modelled on the structure of neurons of
               the brain; convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a commonly
               used example in neuroradiology. RESULTS Radiomics is a frequently
               used approach in which a multitude of imaging features are

               set was comprised of 22 LPA cases and 16 sPHEO cases from two
               other hospitals. We used 3D Slicer and PyRadiomics to segment
               tumors and extract radiomic features, respectively. We then
               applied T-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection
               operator (LASSO) to select features. Six binary classifiers,
               including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR),
               decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine
               (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were employed to
               differentiate LPA from sPHEO. Receiver operating characteristic
               (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were compared
               using DeLong's method. RESULTS: All six classifiers showed good
               diagnostic performance for each phase and slice thickness, as
               well as for the entire CT data, with AUC values ranging from
               0.706 to 1. Non-contrast CT densities of LPA were significantly
               lower than those of sPHEO (P < 0.001). However, using the optimal
               threshold for non-contrast CT density, sensitivity was only
               0.743, specificity 0.744, and AUC 0.828. Delayed phase CT density
               yielded a sensitivity of 0.971, specificity of 0.641, and AUC of
               0.814. In radiomics, AUC values for the testing set using
               non-contrast CT images were: KNN 0.919, LR 0.979, DT 0.835, RF
               0.967, SVM 0.979, and MLP 0.981. In the validation set, AUC
               values were: KNN 0.891, LR 0.974, DT 0.891, RF 0.964, SVM 0.949,
               and MLP 0.979. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model based on
               CT radiomics can accurately differentiate LPA from sPHEO, even
               using non-contrast CT data alone, making contrast-enhanced CT
               unnecessary for diagnosing LPA and sPHEO.",

              and large, lipid poor adrenal adenoma (LPAA) via imaging is
              challenging due to overlapping imaging characteristics. This study
              investigated the ability of deep learning to distinguish ACC and
              LPAA on single time-point CT images. METHODS: Retrospective cohort
              study from 1994 to 2022. Imaging studies of patients with adrenal
              masses who had available adequate CT studies and histology as the
              reference standard by method of adrenal biopsy and/or
              adrenalectomy were included as well as four patients with LPAA
              determined by stability or regression on follow-up imaging.
              Forty-eight (48) subjects with pathology-proven, stage 1-2 ACC and
              43 subjects with adrenal adenoma >3 cm in size demonstrating a
              mean non-contrast CT attenuation > 20 Hounsfield Units centrally
              were included. We used annotated single time-point
              contrast-enhanced CT images of these adrenal masses as input to a
              3D Densenet121 model for classifying as ACC or LPAA with five-fold
              cross-validation. For each fold, two checkpoints were reported,
              highest accuracy with highest sensitivity (accuracy focused) and
              highest sensitivity with the highest accuracy (sensitivity
              focused). RESULTS: We trained a deep learning model (3D
              Densenet121) to predict ACC versus LPAA. The sensitivity-focused
              model achieved mean accuracy: 87.2\% and mean sensitivity: 100\%.
              The accuracy-focused model achieved mean accuracy: 91\% and mean
              sensitivity: 96\%. CONCLUSION: Deep learning demonstrates
              promising results distinguishing between ACC and large LPAA using
              single time-point CT images. Before being widely adopted in
              clinical practice, multicentric and external validation are

              the classification of benign lipid-poor adenomas, which may
              potentially help clinicians limit the number of unnecessary
              investigations in clinical practice. Indeterminate adrenal lesions
              of benign and malignant nature may exhibit different values of key
              radiomics features. METHODS: Patients who had available
              histopathology reports and a non-contrast-enhanced CT scan were
              included in the study. Radiomics feature extraction was done after
              the adrenal lesions were contoured. The primary feature selection
              and prediction performance scores were calculated using the least
              absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). To eliminate
              redundancy, the best-performing features were further examined
              using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and new predictive
              models were created. RESULTS: This investigation covered 50
              lesions in 48 patients. After LASSO-based radiomics feature
              selection, the test dataset's 30 iterations of logistic regression
              models produced an average performance of 0.72. The model with the
              best performance, made up of 13 radiomics features, had an AUC of
              0.99 in the training phase and 1.00 in the test phase. The number
              of features was lowered to 5 after performing Pearson's
              correlation to prevent overfitting. The final radiomic signature
              trained a number of machine learning classifiers, with an average
              AUC of 0.93. CONCLUSIONS: Including more radiomics features in the
              identification of adenomas may improve the accuracy of NECT and
              reduce the need for additional imaging procedures and clinical
              workup, according to this and other recent radiomics studies that
              have clear points of contact with current clinical practice.
              CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The study developed a radiomic
              signature using unenhanced CT scans for classifying lipid-poor
              adenomas, potentially reducing unnecessary investigations that
              scored a final accuracy of 93\%. KEY POINTS: • Radiomics has
              potential for differentiating lipid-poor adenomas and avoiding
              unnecessary further investigations. • Quadratic mean, strength,
              maximum 3D diameter, volume density, and area density are
              promising predictors for adenomas. • Radiomics models reach high
              performance with average AUC of 0.95 in the training phase and
              0.72 in the test phase.",

               by biochemical analysis. Traditional imaging tests have
               limitations and cannot be used alone to diagnose FATs. In this
               study, we aimed to establish an artificially intelligent
               diagnostic model based on computed tomography (CT) images to
               distinguish different types of FATs. Methods: A cohort study of
               375 patients diagnosed with hyperaldosteronism (HA), Cushing's
               syndrome (CS), and pheochromocytoma in our center between March
               2015 and June 2020 was conducted. Retrospectively, patients were
               randomly divided into three data sets: the training set (270
               cases), the testing set (60 cases), and the retrospective trial
               set (45 cases). An artificially intelligent diagnostic model
               based on CT images was established by transferring data from the
               training set into the deep learning network. The testing set was
               then used to evaluate the accuracy of the model compared to that
               of physicians' judgments. The retrospective trial set was used to
               evaluate the quantification and distinction performance. Results:
               The deep learning model achieved an average area under the
               receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.915, and
               the AUCs in all three FAT types were greater than 0.882. The AUC
               of the model tested on the retrospective dataset reached above
               0.849. In the quantitative evaluation of tumor lesion area
               recognition, the diagnostic model also obtained a segmentation
               Dice coefficient of 0.69. With the help of the proposed model,
               clinicians reached 92.5\% accuracy in distinguishing FATs,
               compared to 80.6\% accuracy when using only their judgment
               (P<0.05). Conclusions: The result of our study shows that the
               diagnostic model based on a deep learning network can distinguish
               and quantify three common FAT types based on texture features of
               contrast-enhanced CT images. The model can quantify and
               distinguish functional tumors without any endocrine tests and can
               assist clinicians in the diagnostic procedure.",

               malignant indeterminate adrenal lesions on contrast-enhanced
               computed tomography (CT) studies. Background: Adrenal
               “incidentalomas” are adrenal lesions that are accidentally
               discovered during workup not related to the adrenal glands; they
               have an incidence as high as 5\%. Small adrenal incidentalomas (
               10 HU) need further evaluation to calculate the absolute
               percentage of washout (APW). If the APW is 10 HU, and APW < 60\%.
               Exclusion criteria included pheochromocytoma and no
               histopathological examination. CT images were converted to Nifti
               format, and adrenal tumors were segmented using Amira software.
               Radiomic features from the adrenal mask were extracted using
               PyRadiomics software after removing redundant features (highly
               pairwise correlated features and low-variance features) using
               recursive feature extraction to select the final discriminative
               set of features. Lastly, the final features were used to build a
               binary classification model using a random forest algorithm,
               which was validated and tested using leave-one-out
               cross-validation, confusion matrix, and receiver operating
               characteristic curve. Results: We found 40 indeterminate adrenal
               lesions (21 benign and 19 malignant). Feature extraction resulted
               in 3947 features, which reduced down to 62 features after
               removing redundancies. Recursive feature elimination resulted in
               the following top 4 discriminative features: gray-level size zone
               matrix-derived size zone non-uniformity from pre-contrast and
               delayed phases, gray-level dependency matrix-derived large
               dependence high gray-level emphasis from venous-phase, and
               gray-level co-occurrence matrix-derived cluster shade from
               delayed-phase. A binary classification model with leave-one-out
               cross-validation showed AUC = 0.85, sensitivity = 84.2\%, and
               specificity = 71.4\%. Conclusion: Machine learning and radiomic
               features extraction can differentiate between benign and
               malignant indeterminate adrenal tumors and can be used to direct
               further workup with high sensitivity and specificity.",

               MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative CT texture analysis was used
               to evaluate 54 histopathologically proven adrenal masses (mean
               size=5.9 cm; range=4.1–10 cm) from 54 patients referred to
               Anderson Cancer Center from January 2002 through April 2014. The
               patient group included 32 women (mean age at mass evaluation=59
               years) and 22 men (mean age at mass evaluation=61 years). Adrenal
               lesions seen on precontrast and venous-phase CT images were
               labelled by three different readers, and the labels were used to
               generate intensity- and geometry-based textural features. The
               textural features and the attenuation values were considered as
               input values for a random forest-based classifier. Similarly, the
               adrenal lesions were classified by two different radiologists
               based on morphological criteria. Prediction accuracy and
               interobserver agreement were compared. RESULTS: The textural
               predictive model achieved a mean accuracy of 82\%, whereas the
               mean accuracy for the radiologists was 68.5\% (p<0.0001). The
               interobserver agreements between the predictive model and
               radiologists 1 and 2 were 0.44 (p<0.0005; 95\% confidence

               the readers' image labels was 0.875±0.04. CONCLUSION: CT texture

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Breast cancer ranks first among cancers affecting
               women's health. Our goal is to develop a fast, high-precision,
               and fully automated breast cancer detection algorithm to improve
               the early detection rate of breast cancer. METHODS: We compare
               different object detection algorithms, including anchor-based and
               anchor-free object detection algorithms for detecting breast
               lesions. Finally, we find that the fully convolutional onestage
               object detection (FCOS) showed the best performance in the
               detection of breast lesions, which is an anchor-free algorithm.
               1) Considering that the detection of breast lesions requires the
               context information of the ultrasound images, we introduce the
               non-local technique, which models long-range dependency between
               pixels to the FCOS algorithm, providing the global context
               information for the detection of the breast lesions. 2) The
               variety of shapes and sizes of breast lesions makes detection
               difficult. We propose a new deformable spatial attention (DSA)
               module and add it to the FCOS algorithm. RESULTS: The detection
               performance of the original FCOS is that the average precision
               (AP) for benign lesions is 0.818, and for malignant lesions is
               0.888. The FCOS with a non-local module improves the performance
               of the breast detection; the AP of benign lesions was 0.819, and
               that of malignant lesions was 0.894. Combining the DSA module
               with the FCOS improves the performance of breast detection; the
               AP for benign lesions and malignant lesions is 0.840 and 0.899,
               respectively. CONCLUSION: We propose two methods to improve the
               FCOS algorithm from different perspectives to improve its
               performance in detecting breast lesions. We find that FCOS
               combined with DSA is beneficial in improving the localization and
               classification of breast tumors and can provide auxiliary
               diagnostic advice for ultrasound physicians, which has a certain
               clinical application value.",

  abstract  = "Lumbar disc herniation is a common spinal disease, and its
               diagnosis and treatment usually rely on medical imaging
               technology. Traditional medical image diagnosis methods require
               high labor and time costs. This article proposes an object
               detection network based on FCOS to achieve automated detection of
               lumbar disc herniation. This network introduces the idea of group
               convolution and incorporates attention mechanisms. In addition,
               the Soft NMS algorithm was used in the inference stage to avoid
               the problem of target boxes being violently deleted. The method
               proposed in this article achieved a mAP of 0.661 on the MRI test
               set, which has higher accuracy compared to other networks. This
               method provides a feasible and effective solution for detecting
               lumbar disc herniation, which is expected to assist doctors in
               clinical diagnosis.",

  abstract      = "In computer vision, object detection is one of most important
                   tasks, which underpins a few instance-level recognition tasks
                   and many downstream applications. Recently one-stage methods
                   have gained much attention over two-stage approaches due to
                   their simpler design and competitive performance. Here we
                   propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector
                   (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel prediction
                   fashion, analogue to other dense prediction problems such as
                   semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art object
                   detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN
                   rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed
                   detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free.
                   By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS
                   completely avoids the complicated computation related to
                   anchor boxes such as calculating the intersection over union
                   (IoU) scores during training. More importantly, we also avoid
                   all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often
                   sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only
                   post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), we demonstrate
                   a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving
                   improved detection accuracy. We hope that the proposed FCOS
                   framework can serve as a simple and strong alternative for
                   many other instance-level tasks. Code and pre-trained models
